     <h1>handcrafted links</h1>

    <p>handcraft links instead of auto-creating bi-directional links, because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>trilium simply doesn't support it (yet)</li>
      <li>we want to make meaningful connections between contents</li>
      <li>it's good to know the limits of your tool</li>
      <li>we can then hide certain contents</li>
    </ul>
