     <h1>writing style</h1>

    <p>(WIP)</p>
    <p>because i have very little to no readership, i write in the way i like
      – that is to say, in the only possible way.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>choice of language</h3>
    <p>i write poor english. nevertheless, i choose to organize some of my notes
      / ideas in this language, because it allows no rhetorics, a trap i easily
      fall into when i use my native language, mandarin chinese.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>therefore, notes written in english will be more condensed, more database-like,
      more definite, more technical. in contrast, when i feel like sharing a
      personal use case / a strong opinion / a vague idea / <s>a flourish of puns</s>,
      i will probably write in 中文.</p>
    <p>i prefer not to translate these pages, so that they remain in context.</p>
    <p>see also:&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="simplistic%20english.html"
      data-note-path="root/J5jC8psBh9md/W8XAyzSumPmR/HaemRFg2e7cG/WyDM9dXgngpv">simplistic english</a>&nbsp;for
      more info on how i deliberately abuse this language.</p>
    <h3>choice of structure</h3>
    <p>the notes in this garden are grown “organically”.</p>
    <p>in less fancy words, i:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>think of a word / an idea i want to expand on today</li>
      <li>make a page and start writing</li>
      <li>add some link to it (which i always forget to!)</li>
      <li>export, prune, proofread, commit changes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>although links are a big feature (and perhaps the whole purpose) of this
      garden, i prefer to use them moderately.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i am also much inspired by <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devine_lu_linvega.html">Devine Lu Linvega</a>'s
      <a
      href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html">xxiivv wiki</a>, which is written in a dictionary format, with lexicons
        and a glossary.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>see also:&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="handcrafted%20links.html"
      data-note-path="root/J5jC8psBh9md/W8XAyzSumPmR/HaemRFg2e7cG/99NCRfW2m2yW">handcrafted links</a>
    </p>
    <h3>choice of topics</h3>
    <p>this site is an example of <a href="how%20to%20build%20this%20garden.html">digital gardening with trilium</a>,
      so expect to see more on that.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>more generally, this will contain a sort of <a href="../cultivation.html">meta wiki</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i'm still figuring out what to do with this space.</p>
    <p>i'd like to grow a distinctive native flora, one that crystallizes from
      very personal thinking.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>i don't want another public wiki that copies over existing knowledge.
      why not just link to wikipedia and leave only personal remarks?</p>
    <p>i grow tired of universal taxonomy. why <a href="writing%20style/borges%20taxonomy.html">categorize things</a> like
      everyone else?</p>
    <p>some practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>coin words / concepts</li>
      <li>develop esoteric / organic categories (instead of “the Intelligence that
        always <i>comes before, </i>the whole that is already present” – <i>proust and signs, anti-logos</i>)</li>
    </ul>
