     <h1>writefreely garden</h1>

    <p>this note describes how to use a <a href="https://writefreely.org/">writefreely</a> multi-user
      instance as a digital garden, as well as its pros and cons.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>basics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a super user</li>
      <li>shut down registration</li>
      <li>set <code>max_blogs</code> to a large number (not sure if 0 stands for infinite,
        will check later)</li>
      <li>create blogs for different topics (see: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/07/17/blogchains/">blog chain</a>)</li>
      <li>use tags for horizontal organization (e.g. general topics)</li>
      <li>the local timeline (“reader”) will be the weblog interface, organized
        in chronological order (the “stream” part)</li>
      <li>mention other topics using their handles</li>
      <li>customize css and landing page as you would with other sites</li>
    </ul>
    <p>advanced:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the public garden (the park?): all the public blogs/topics that show up
        on the timeline</li>
      <li>the unlisted garden: not accessible via timeline, but traceable by entering
        keywords</li>
      <li>the anonymous garden:
        <ul>
          <li>use anonymous posts for improvised/wip topics, then move them into a new
            blog</li>
          <li>anonymous posts are visible, but they have unique hashes, thus making
            them sort of “hidden”</li>
          <li>anonymous posts are almost undiscoverable, until you explicitly link to
            them from somewhere</li>
          <li>i found this very handy when i needed to share a piece of wip research
            with my friends</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>collaboration: just send out invitation links to people
        <ul>
          <li>however, this will be a “partial collab” because they won't be able to
            change your content</li>
          <li>however, however, this is not a wiki system anyway</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>pros:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>each blog chain has its own handle in the fediverse (may also be a con!)</li>
      <li>easy content management</li>
      <li>seamless writing with markdown</li>
      <li>no deploys! no compilations! anymore</li>
      <li>export content to json or plain text anytime anywhere</li>
    </ul>
    <p>cons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>needs a server</li>
      <li>no full-text search (yet, but the site can be indexed by a search engine)</li>
    </ul>
